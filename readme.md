# Ecommerce website

I have put many features in this project, where the user can create a new account, register on the site, buy products (clothes, t-shirts, books), delete them from the shopping cart, adjust their quantity, pay on arrival or through a PayPal account, and if they encounter any Problem: He can send a message through the communication page, and the user can add a picture to his account or change the password and log out. The administrator can add or delete products to the site, and see the messages sent by customers
